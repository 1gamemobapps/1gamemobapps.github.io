To put it simply, with respect to such Kids Non-personal Information, 1Game and the Third Parties are not aware of the identity of the User from whom Kids Non-personal Information has been collected. Kids Non-personal Information collected by either 1Game or Third Parties may include technical information such as: type of operating system (e.g. Android, iOS, etc.), type of browser (e.g. Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.), screen resolution (e.g. 800&times;600, 1024&times;768, etc.), User session ID, time zone, session start / stop time, source of traffic (e.g. which ad units, sites or applications, and campaigns a User came from), language (e.g. English), device type (e.g. Galaxy, HTC, iPhone, etc.), data regarding User behavior within our Kids Apps (e.g. advertisements impressions, User&rsquo;s response to advertisements (including advertisements viewed or clicked), User&rsquo;s in-app purchases, User&rsquo;s gameplay (e.g. level reached, frequency and time spent in the Kids App and in each level, game progress, fail rate, mini game(s) played, virtual currency (if any) collected or earned, tools and in-app functionalities used, screens accessed, User retention, performance errors and problems, Kids Apps&rsquo; stability, crashes, functioning, etc.), and other predefined events and behavior relating thereto (e.g. if User viewed a specific advertisement and other game play events, time of the event, internet connectivity (Wi-Fi, 3G), device time zone, etc.), other 1Game Apps installed, User age-related information (meaning whether a User passes an age-gate, if included to prevent access to certain features to Users who do not pass the age-gate to protect Kids privacy), randomly generated User ID which may not be matched back to the User, and geo-location - only at a country level.
