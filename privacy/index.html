TabTale does not collect and does not permit Third Parties to collect from Kids any information that may personally identify an individual (e.g.name, address, e-mail) (other than the Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier which is collected for the limited purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Kids Apps) and any other personally identifiable information of a private and/or sensitive nature about the Kids. We note that TabTale may collect, use and provide access to the User's advertising identifier in accordance with the applicable platform provider's policies.
                                <br>

                                <u>Purpose of the collection:</u> The information abovementioned is collected and processed solely for the purpose of supporting TabTale’s internal operations. This means the following:
                                <ol class="numlist" type="I">

                        <p><u>How the  Information about our Users of Kids Apps is being collected?</u> The abovementioned Kids Non-personal Information and Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier are collected either by TabTale or by Third Parties through the Users’ use of the Kids Apps, including, without limitation, through Third Parties’ SDK embedded in our Kids Apps. In addition, Kids Non-personal Information and the Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier may also be stored locally on the Users’ device via generally accepted industry technologies used within the Kids Apps, such as “cookies-like technology” and local storage (see Section 19 below for further details with respect to Cookies and Local Storage).</p>

                        If Third Parties whose SDK is installed in the Kids Apps collect Kids Non-personal Information, Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier and/or any other information directly from Kids, such collection and processing is governed by such Third Parties’ privacy policies and not by this Privacy Policy. However, all Third Parties are carefully selected to preserve compliance with applicable privacy laws, and we confirm that they are compliant with COPPA in performance of their services for TabTale.
                        <br>
                        <br> TabTale does not collect or process any financial or payment information, any government identification numbers, any non-public phonebook or contact information, any microphone and camera sensor data, or any sensitive device data concerning Kids.
                        <h3><strong>4. </strong><strong><u>Sharing Kids information with third  parties</u></strong></h3>
                        <p>We may share the Kids’ Persistent Device Identifier only in limited cases, including the following:</p>

                            <li>to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena or governmental request;</li>
                            <li>to enforce this Kids Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof;</li>
                            <li>to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;</li>
                            <li>to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of TabTale, its Users, suppliers, licensors, and/or licensees, or the general public;</li>
                            <li>when TabTale is undergoing any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of Company, in which case it may also be disclosed, transferred and/or assigned; and/or</li>
                            <li>pursuant to the approval of a Kid’s legal guardian, in order to supply certain services that such legal guardian or the User of the Kids Apps may have requested from the Company;</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For avoidance of doubt, TabTale may transfer and disclose Kids Non-personal Information to third parties at its discretion.</p>
                        <h3><strong>5. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advertising</strong></span></h3>
                        <p>
                            We accept advertisements from Third Party ad networks which may be displayed in our Kids Apps. These Third Parties ad networks are carefully selected to preserve compliance with applicable privacy laws, and we confirm that they are compliant with COPPA in performance of their services for TabTale. Note that if the User of the Kids Apps clicks on any of these advertisements, the User will leave our Kids Apps and go to the advertisers’ site the User selected, and the advertisers may use cookies and other web-tracking technologies to collect Kids Non-personal Information and/or Kids personally identifiable information. We recommend that you, as the legal guardian of a Kid, review the terms of use and privacy policy for any advertiser with whom you and/or the User of the Kids Apps are interacting before doing so. Their privacy policy, not ours, will apply to any of those interactions.
                            <br>
                            <br> In addition, TabTale may, at its discretion, advertise other TabTale Apps within the Kids Apps. Such advertisements are not directed towards specific Users but are rather broadly posted onto random TabTale Apps.

                        <p>When you access or use the Apps, we and/or our Third Parties may use industry-wide technologies such as “cookies”, web beacons, tags and local storage (or other similar technologies), which store certain local information on your device (“<strong>Local  Storage</strong>”), to identify a User’s device and 'remember' things about the User which may enable, <em>inter alia</em>, automatic activation of certain features (for example, if a User muted the sound within the App at a certain stage, this preference will be stored in the cache on the device and maintained the next time the User accesses the App on his device), monitoring of use of the Apps (counting Users who visit certain pages, use certain tools, viewed certain advertisements), frequency capping (for example, if we promote another App, this ensures that we do not advertise the same App more than a set number of times), to improve the quality of our services, measure ad performance, provide relevant advertisements etc. and making the User’s App experience and usage simpler, more relevant, convenient and effortless. Such information is locally stored in the User’s device. TabTale and/or Third Parties may access such information. Third Parties may use both session cookies (which expire once you close the App) and persistent cookies (which stay on the User’s device until he/she deletes them). Such Local Storage used by the Apps may store non-personal information (such as the different pages viewed by a User within the App) as well as User persistent identifier and geo-location data, which will be collected in accordance with the terms specified herein. It is easy to prohibit and/or delete the Local Storage, <em>inter alia</em>, via uninstalling the App from your mobile device and/or through the Settings option of your device. Most browsers and platforms will allow you to erase cookies from a device, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option you may use the settings option of your device or according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider and/or Third Parties privacy policies and terms of use. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of your device, your App experience may be affected and may be limited.</p>

                        <p>A User may prevent or limit targeted advertising from device settings which may vary from device to device.

If you are using Google Android device with Android 2.3 or a later version, you can find the ad identifier settings in the app drawer under Google Settings&gt; Ads. Please note that activation of any applicable “Do-not-track” settings on the User’s mobile device or any other device-level setting opt outs for targeted advertising, (to the extent that such options exist) may not cease all tracking activities by TabTale’s third parties' service providers.
